\chapter{Methodology and Implementation}
\label{chap:implementation}
 
In this chapter the implementation of the GraphSLAM algorithm is presented and explained. The implementation created is capable of solving the SLAM problem in an offline manner for a 2D scenario, in the cases of known and unknown data association.

The g$^2$o framework used in this work provides of a least squares solver for the optimization of~\eqref{eq:minimization}, as well as a protocol to define a graph in the SLAM problem. g$^2$o is well optimized and it has several options for optimization, so the known correspondence version of the GraphSLAM algorithm is relative straightforward to implement.

However, g$^2$o doesn't provide a way to handle unknown data association, so the main goal of this work is to implement a method for solving the correspondence problem in an efficient manner.
